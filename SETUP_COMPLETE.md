# üéâ Fin-o1-14B Setup Complete!

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the environment to run the Fin-o1-14B model from Hugging Face.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Set Up

- **Python Virtual Environment**: `fin_o1_env` with all required dependencies
- **Core Dependencies**: PyTorch, Transformers, Accelerate, and more
- **Multiple Runner Scripts**: Different options for various use cases
- **Memory Optimization**: CPU-optimized versions for limited RAM environments
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive setup verification

## üöÄ How to Run the Model

### Option 1: Use the Launcher (Recommended)
```bash
source fin_o1_env/bin/activate
python3 launch.py
```

### Option 2: Direct Script Execution
```bash
source fin_o1_env/bin/activate

# Test your setup first
python3 test_setup.py

# Choose your runner:
python3 lightweight_run.py    # Memory-optimized for CPU
python3 simple_run.py         # Simple pipeline runner
python3 run_model.py          # Advanced with quantization
python3 quick_start.py        # Quick test with predefined prompts
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### System Requirements
- **Current System**: 15GB RAM, CPU-only
- **Model Size**: ~30GB download + runtime memory
- **Performance**: CPU inference will be very slow (10+ minutes for first load)

### Memory Considerations
- The 14B parameter model requires significant memory
- With 15GB RAM, you may experience:
  - Very slow loading (10+ minutes)
  - Potential memory issues during generation
  - Limited response length

### Recommendations
1. **For Production Use**: Use a machine with 32GB+ RAM or GPU
2. **For Testing/Learning**: Current setup is sufficient
3. **For Better Performance**: Consider smaller model variants

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If the model fails to load:
1. Ensure virtual environment is activated
2. Check available memory: `free -h`
3. Try the lightweight runner first
4. Consider using a smaller model for testing

### If you get memory errors:
1. Close other applications
2. Use the lightweight runner
3. Limit conversation history
4. Restart with fresh memory

## üìö Available Scripts

1. **`test_setup.py`** - Verify environment is ready
2. **`lightweight_run.py`** - Memory-optimized for CPU/limited RAM
3. **`simple_run.py`** - Basic pipeline-based runner
4. **`run_model.py`** - Advanced features with quantization
5. **`quick_start.py`** - Quick test with predefined prompts
6. **`launch.py`** - Interactive launcher for all options

## üåü Next Steps

1. **Test Your Setup**: Run `python3 test_setup.py`
2. **Try the Model**: Start with `python3 lightweight_run.py`
3. **Explore Features**: Use the launcher to try different options
4. **Customize**: Modify scripts for your specific needs

## üí° Tips for Best Experience

- **First Run**: Be patient - model download and loading takes time
- **Memory Management**: Use lightweight runner on limited systems
- **Interactive Mode**: Great for testing and learning
- **Response Length**: Keep prompts reasonable for better performance

## üÜò Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the troubleshooting section in README.md
2. Verify system resources meet minimum requirements
3. Try different runner scripts
4. Check Hugging Face model page for updates
