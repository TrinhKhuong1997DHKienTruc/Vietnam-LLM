```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Model Parameters
- **Max Tokens**: Control response length (100-1000)
- **Temperature**: Control creativity (0.1-1.5, lower = more focused)
- **Device**: Automatic detection of CUDA/CPU/MPS

### Hardware Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (recommended)
- **CPU**: Multi-core CPU with 16GB+ RAM
- **Storage**: 20GB+ free space for model download

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Out of Memory Error**
   - Reduce batch size or use CPU mode
   - Close other applications to free memory
   - Use model quantization if available

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Ensure CUDA is properly installed
   - Check GPU memory usage
   - Consider using CPU mode for smaller models

3. **Model Download Issues**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Hugging Face access
   - Clear Hugging Face cache if needed

### Performance Tips

- **GPU Mode**: Significantly faster than CPU mode
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple prompts together when possible
- **Model Caching**: Models are cached after first download
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust temperature and max_tokens for optimal results
