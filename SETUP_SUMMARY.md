# 🎯 Setup Complete - Ready to Run Fin-o1-14B!

## ✅ What We've Built

I've created a complete setup for running the **Fin-o1-14B** model from Hugging Face. Here's what you now have:

### 📁 Files Created
- **`setup.sh`** - Automated setup script (executable)
- **`requirements.txt`** - All necessary Python dependencies
- **`run_fin_o1.py`** - Main model runner with interactive chat
- **`demo.py`** - Pre-built financial analysis examples
- **`test_setup.py`** - Environment verification script
- **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
- **`QUICKSTART.md`** - 3-step quick start guide

### 🚀 Key Features
- **Quantization Support**: 8-bit (16GB GPU) and 4-bit (8GB GPU) options
- **Interactive Chat**: Full conversation mode with the AI
- **Single Prompt Mode**: Run individual financial questions
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient GPU memory usage
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and troubleshooting
- **Demo Examples**: Pre-built financial analysis prompts

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Run the Setup (Required)
```bash
./setup.sh
```
This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install PyTorch with CUDA support (if available)
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up the environment

### 2. Activate Environment
```bash
source fin_o1_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Test the Setup
```bash
python test_setup.py
```

### 4. Run the Model
```bash
# Interactive mode
python run_fin_o1.py

# Or see the demo
python demo.py
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Interactive Chat
```bash
python run_fin_o1.py
```
Then ask questions like:
- "What is the difference between stocks and bonds?"
- "How do I analyze a company's financial statements?"
- "What are the main investment risks?"

### Single Prompt
```bash
python run_fin_o1.py --prompt "Explain value investing strategies"
```

### Memory Optimization
```bash
# For 8GB GPU memory
python run_fin_o1.py --4bit

# For 16GB+ GPU memory (default)
python run_fin_o1.py
```

## 🔧 System Requirements

- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM (16GB+ recommended)
- **RAM**: 16GB+ system RAM
- **Storage**: 30GB+ free space
- **OS**: Linux (you're all set!)
- **Python**: 3.8+ (you have 3.13.3 ✓)

## 🎉 What You'll Get

The **Fin-o1-14B** model is a specialized financial AI that can:
- Analyze financial statements
- Explain investment strategies
- Discuss risk management
- Provide market insights
- Answer banking questions
- Give financial advice

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. **Check the README.md** for detailed documentation
2. **Run `python test_setup.py`** to diagnose issues
3. **Use `--4bit` flag** if you have memory issues
4. **Check GPU drivers** if CUDA isn't working

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

Your environment is ready! Just run:
```bash
./setup.sh
```

The first run will download the ~28GB model, then you'll have a powerful financial AI at your fingertips! 🎯
